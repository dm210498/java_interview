### 1. What is Redis and how does it work?

**Answer**: Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Redis operates primarily in memory, which allows for extremely fast read and write operations. It can persist data to disk using snapshotting (RDB) or append-only file (AOF) methods, providing a balance between performance and durability.

**Justification**: This answer provides a comprehensive overview of Redis, covering its purpose, key features, and operational mechanisms. It demonstrates a solid understanding of Redis’s capabilities and how it achieves high performance, which is essential for a Senior Java Developer.

### 2. How does Redis handle persistence?

**Answer**: Redis handles persistence using two main methods: RDB (Redis Database) snapshots and AOF (Append-Only File). RDB snapshots create point-in-time snapshots of the dataset at specified intervals, which are saved to disk. AOF logs every write operation received by the server, allowing for more fine-grained persistence. AOF can be configured to fsync (synchronize) data to disk at different intervals (every write, every second, or never), balancing performance and durability.

**Justification**: This answer explains the two primary persistence mechanisms in Redis, demonstrating an understanding of how Redis ensures data durability. It shows that you can configure and manage Redis persistence based on application requirements.

### 3. What are the data types supported by Redis?

**Answer**: Redis supports several data types, including:

- **Strings**: Simple key-value pairs.
- **Hashes**: Maps between string fields and string values, ideal for representing objects.
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of strings, supporting operations like push, pop, and range queries.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique strings, supporting operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but with an associated score for each member, allowing for sorted order.
- **Bitmaps**: Bit-level operations on strings.
- **HyperLogLogs**: Probabilistic data structures for counting unique items with low memory usage.
- **Streams**: Log data structures for managing data streams.

**Justification**: This answer lists and briefly describes the data types supported by Redis, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of its versatility. It shows that you can leverage the appropriate data structures for different use cases.

### 4. How would you use Redis to implement a rate limiter?

**Answer**: To implement a rate limiter in Redis, you can use the INCR command along with EXPIRE. For example, to limit a user to 10 requests per minute, you can create a key with the user’s identifier and increment it with each request. If the key does not exist, set it with an expiration time of 60 seconds. If the incremented value exceeds the limit, deny the request.

Java

```java
String key = "user:" + userId + ":requests";
long requests = jedis.incr(key);
if (requests == 1) {
    jedis.expire(key, 60);
}
if (requests > 10) {
    // Deny request
}
```

**Justification**: This answer provides a practical example of using Redis to implement a rate limiter, demonstrating an understanding of Redis commands and their application in real-world scenarios. It shows that you can design and implement efficient solutions using Redis.

### 5. Can you briefly describe the concept of Redis pub/sub model?

**Answer**: The Redis pub/sub (publish/subscribe) model allows messages to be sent to multiple clients (subscribers) through channels. Publishers send messages to channels without knowing the subscribers, and subscribers receive messages from channels they are subscribed to. This decouples the producers and consumers of messages, enabling scalable and flexible communication patterns.

**Justification**: This answer explains the pub/sub model in Redis, demonstrating an understanding of how Redis can be used for messaging and event-driven architectures. It shows that you can leverage Redis for real-time communication and notifications.

### 6. How do you ensure data consistency in a distributed Redis environment?

**Answer**: Ensuring data consistency in a distributed Redis environment involves using techniques such as:

- **Replication**: Setting up master-slave replication to ensure data is copied to multiple nodes.
- **Sentinel**: Using Redis Sentinel for high availability and automatic failover.
- **Cluster**: Deploying Redis in a clustered mode to distribute data across multiple nodes and ensure consistency through sharding and replication.
- **Transactions**: Using Redis transactions (MULTI/EXEC) to execute a series of commands atomically.

**Justification**: This answer outlines strategies for ensuring data consistency in a distributed Redis environment, demonstrating an understanding of advanced Redis features. It shows that you can design and manage robust, high-availability Redis deployments.
