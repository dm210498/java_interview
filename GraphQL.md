### 1.**What is GraphQL and how does it differ from REST?**

 GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, while REST is an architectural style where clients make requests to different endpoints that return fixed data structures. 
**Justification:** Understanding the fundamental differences between GraphQL and REST is crucial for roles involving API development, as it demonstrates your ability to choose the right tool for efficient data fetching and management.

### 2. **Explain the concept of a GraphQL schema.**

 A GraphQL schema defines the structure of the API, including the types of data that can be queried, the relationships between those types, and the operations that can be performed. 
**Justification:** A well-defined schema is essential for maintaining a clear and consistent API, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API effectively.

### 3. **What are queries in GraphQL?**

 Queries are used to read data from the API. They allow clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. 
**Justification:** Queries are the primary way clients interact with a GraphQL API, so understanding how to write efficient and effective queries is key.
### 4. **What are mutations in GraphQL?**

 Mutations are used to write or modify data in the API. They allow clients to perform actions that change the state of the data. 
**Justification:** Mutations are essential for enabling clients to interact with the API in ways that go beyond just reading data, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.
### 5 **Describe the purpose of resolvers in GraphQL.**

 Resolvers are functions that fetch the data for a specific field in a GraphQL query. They act as the bridge between the schema and the data source. **Justification:** Resolvers are crucial for implementing the logic that retrieves data, making them a key component of a GraphQL API.
### 6. **How do you handle errors in GraphQL?**

 Errors in GraphQL are handled by returning a structured response that includes both the data and any errors that occurred during the query execution. **Justification:** Structured error handling ensures that clients can gracefully handle failures and still receive partial results if possible.
### 7. **What is the role of the GraphQL server?**

 The GraphQL server is responsible for executing queries and mutations, validating them against the schema, and returning the appropriate data or errors. **Justification:** Understanding the role of the server helps in designing and maintaining a robust GraphQL API.
### 8. **Explain the difference between queries and subscriptions in GraphQL.**

Queries are used to read data, while subscriptions are used to listen for real-time updates from the API.

**Justification:** Knowing the difference between these operations is important for implementing real-time features in your API.
### 9. **How can you implement pagination in a GraphQL query?**

Pagination can be implemented using arguments in the query to specify the number of items to return and the starting point for the list. **Justification:** Pagination is a common requirement for APIs, and understanding how to implement it efficiently is important.
### 10. **What are fragments in GraphQL?**

 Fragments are reusable units of query syntax that define sets of fields. They allow clients to compose complex queries by combining fragments. **Justification:** Fragments help avoid repetition and make queries more modular and maintainable.
### 11. **Explain the concept of input types in GraphQL and provide an example.**

 Input types are used to define the shape of data that can be passed as arguments to queries and mutations. For example, an input type for creating a user might include fields for name, email, and password. **Justification:** Input types ensure that the data passed to the API is well-structured and valid.
### 12. **Write a GraphQL mutation to create a new user.**

``` graphql
mutation CreateUser($name: String!, $email: String!, $password: String!) {
  createUser(name: $name, email: $email, password: $password) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```
\*\*Justification\:\*\* Writing mutations demonstrates your ability to define and implement operations that modify the state of the API.

### 13. **How do you implement authentication in a GraphQL API?**

 Authentication can be implemented using middleware to intercept requests and validate tokens, or by using directives to enforce authorization rules at the schema level. 
\*\*Justification\:\*\* Proper authentication ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data and operations.

### 14. **What is the purpose of the @deprecated directive in GraphQL?**

 The @deprecated directive marks fields or types that should no longer be used, providing a way to phase out functionality without breaking existing clients. 
\*\*Justification\:\*\* Using the @deprecated directive helps manage API evolution and communicate changes to clients.

### 15. **Write a GraphQL query that uses variables to fetch a user by ID.**



graphql

Copy

```
query GetUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```


\*\*Justification\:\*\* Using variables in queries makes them more flexible and reusable, allowing clients to fetch data dynamically.

### 16. **Explain the concept of batching and caching in GraphQL.**

 Batching and caching are techniques used to improve the performance of a GraphQL API by reducing the number of database queries and reusing previously fetched data. 
\*\*Justification\:\*\* Efficient use of batching and caching can significantly enhance the performance and scalability of a GraphQL API.

### 17. **How do you handle nested queries in GraphQL?**

 Nested queries can be handled by defining fields that return other types, allowing clients to fetch related data in a single query. 
\*\*Justification\:\*\* Handling nested queries efficiently is important for reducing the number of requests and improving performance.

### 18. **Write a GraphQL subscription to listen for new messages in a chat application.**


``` graphql
subscription OnNewMessage {
  newMessage {
    id
    content
    sender
  }
}
```

**Justification:** Subscriptions enable real-time updates, which are essential for applications like chat systems.

### 19. **What are the benefits of using GraphQL over traditional REST APIs?**

 GraphQL offers more efficient data fetching, strong typing, and the ability to fetch related data in a single request, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. **Justification:** Understanding these benefits helps in advocating for the use of GraphQL in appropriate scenarios.

### 20. **Describe how to implement
