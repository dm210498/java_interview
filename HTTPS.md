### 1. What is HTTPS and how does it differ from HTTP?

**Answer**: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data being transferred between the client and the server. This encryption ensures that the data remains secure and cannot be intercepted by malicious actors. The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS is the use of SSL/TLS encryption in HTTPS, which provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

**Justification**: This answer clearly explains the fundamental difference between HTTP and HTTPS, highlighting the importance of encryption for security. It demonstrates an understanding of the need for secure communication in web applications.

### 2. How does SSL/TLS encryption work in HTTPS?

**Answer**: SSL/TLS encryption works by establishing a secure connection between the client and the server through a process called the SSL/TLS handshake. During this handshake, the server presents a digital certificate to the client, which the client verifies. Once verified, the client and server agree on encryption algorithms and generate session keys to encrypt the data. This ensures that all data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted and secure.

**Justification**: This answer provides a concise explanation of the SSL/TLS handshake process, demonstrating an understanding of how encryption works in HTTPS. It shows that you are familiar with the technical details of establishing a secure connection.

### 3. What are digital certificates and how are they used in HTTPS?

**Answer**: Digital certificates are electronic documents used to verify the identity of a website or server. They are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and contain the public key of the server along with other identifying information. In HTTPS, digital certificates are used during the SSL/TLS handshake to authenticate the server to the client. The client verifies the certificate against a list of trusted CAs to ensure that it is valid and has not been tampered with.

**Justification**: This answer explains the role of digital certificates in HTTPS, demonstrating an understanding of how authentication is achieved. It shows that you are aware of the importance of trusted CAs in establishing secure connections.

### 4. What are some common vulnerabilities in HTTPS and how can they be mitigated?

**Answer**: Common vulnerabilities in HTTPS include:

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: These can be mitigated by using strong encryption algorithms and ensuring that digital certificates are properly validated.
- **SSL/TLS Protocol Vulnerabilities**: Regularly updating SSL/TLS libraries and disabling outdated protocols (e.g., SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0) can mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- **Certificate Spoofing**: Using Certificate Pinning can help ensure that the client only accepts certificates from known, trusted sources.

**Justification**: This answer identifies common vulnerabilities and provides practical mitigation strategies, demonstrating an understanding of security best practices. It shows that you are aware of potential threats and how to address them.

### 5. How do you implement HTTPS in a Java web application?

**Answer**: To implement HTTPS in a Java web application, you need to:

1. Obtain a digital certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
2. Configure your web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat) to use the certificate and enable SSL/TLS.
3. Update your application’s configuration to use HTTPS URLs.
4. Optionally, enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS.

For example, in Apache Tomcat, you would configure the `server.xml` file to include the SSL/TLS connector with the path to your certificate and private key.

**Justification**: This answer provides a step-by-step approach to implementing HTTPS, demonstrating practical knowledge of configuring a Java web application for secure communication. It shows that you understand the process and can apply it in a real-world scenario.

### 6. What is HSTS and why is it important?

**Answer**: HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) is a security policy mechanism that helps protect websites against downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It instructs browsers to only interact with the server using HTTPS, even if the user attempts to access the site via HTTP. HSTS is important because it ensures that all communications with the server are encrypted, reducing the risk of certain types of attacks.

**Justification**: This answer explains the purpose and importance of HSTS, demonstrating an understanding of advanced security mechanisms. It shows that you are aware of additional measures to enhance the security of web applications.
