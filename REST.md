### 1. What is REST and how does it work?

**Answer**: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol, typically HTTP. RESTful applications use HTTP methods explicitly and are designed around resources, which are identified by URLs. Each resource can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

**Justification**: This answer provides a clear and concise explanation of REST, covering its purpose and basic operation. It demonstrates a fundamental understanding of how RESTful principles are applied in web development, which is essential for a Senior Java Developer.

### 2. What are the main principles of REST?

**Answer**: The main principles of REST include:

- **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separate entities that interact through a uniform interface. This separation allows for independent evolution of the client and server.
- **Cacheability**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.
- **Layered System**: A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or an intermediary along the way.
- **Uniform Interface**: The uniform interface simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently.

**Justification**: This answer outlines the core principles of REST, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the architectural style. It shows that you are familiar with the foundational concepts that guide RESTful design.

### 3. What is the difference between PUT and POST methods in REST?

**Answer**:

- **PUT**: The PUT method is used to update or create a resource at a specific URL. It is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.
- **POST**: The POST method is used to create a new resource. It is not idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests may result in multiple resources being created.

**Justification**: This answer clearly distinguishes between PUT and POST, demonstrating an understanding of how different HTTP methods are used in RESTful APIs. It shows that you can correctly apply these methods in designing and implementing APIs.

### 4. What is content negotiation in RESTful APIs?

**Answer**: Content negotiation is a mechanism that allows clients and servers to agree on the format of the data to be exchanged. The client specifies its preferred formats using the `Accept` header, and the server responds with the data in one of the requested formats, indicated by the `Content-Type` header. This allows RESTful APIs to support multiple data formats, such as JSON, XML, and HTML.

**Justification**: This answer explains the concept of content negotiation, demonstrating an understanding of how RESTful APIs can be designed to be flexible and interoperable. It shows that you are aware of the importance of supporting different data formats in APIs.

### 5. What are HTTP status codes and how are they used in RESTful APIs?

**Answer**: HTTP status codes are standardized codes returned by the server to indicate the result of a client’s request. They are grouped into five categories:

- **1xx (Informational)**: Request received, continuing process.
- **2xx (Success)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted (e.g., 200 OK).
- **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).
- **4xx (Client Error)**: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled (e.g., 404 Not Found).
- **5xx (Server Error)**: The server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

In RESTful APIs, these status codes are used to communicate the outcome of the request to the client, providing information about whether the request was successful, if there were errors, or if further action is needed.

**Justification**: This answer categorizes HTTP status codes and provides examples, demonstrating an understanding of how servers communicate the results of requests. It shows that you can interpret and handle different types of responses in web applications.

### 6. What is HATEOAS and why is it important in RESTful APIs?

**Answer**: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of the REST architectural style that ensures that a client interacts with a RESTful API entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. This means that the server provides links to related resources and actions within the responses, allowing clients to navigate the API dynamically.

**Justification**: This answer explains the concept of HATEOAS, demonstrating an understanding of advanced RESTful principles. It shows that you are aware of how hypermedia can enhance the usability and discoverability of APIs.

### 7. How do you handle versioning in RESTful APIs?

**Answer**: There are several strategies for versioning RESTful APIs, including:

- **URI Versioning**: Including the version number in the URI (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`).
- **Query Parameter Versioning**: Using a query parameter to specify the version (e.g., `/api/resource?version=1`).
- **Header Versioning**: Specifying the version in the request header (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`).

Each strategy has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

**Justification**: This answer provides multiple strategies for API versioning, demonstrating an understanding of the different approaches and their implications. It shows that you can choose and implement an appropriate versioning strategy based on project needs.
