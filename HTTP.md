### 1. What is HTTP and how does it work?

**Answer**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests and information between clients (such as web browsers) and servers. HTTP operates as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. A client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested resource or an error message.

**Justification**: This answer provides a clear and concise explanation of HTTP, covering its purpose and basic operation. It demonstrates a fundamental understanding of how web communication works, which is essential for a Senior Java Developer.

### 2. What are the main HTTP methods and their purposes?

**Answer**: The main HTTP methods are:

- **GET**: Requests a representation of the specified resource. It should only retrieve data and have no other effect.
- **POST**: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. It often results in a change in state or side effects on the server.
- **PUT**: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- **DELETE**: Removes the specified resource.
- **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
- **HEAD**: Similar to GET, but it transfers the status line and header section only.
- **OPTIONS**: Describes the communication options for the target resource.

**Justification**: This answer lists the main HTTP methods and briefly describes their purposes, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of how different types of HTTP requests are used in web development.

### 3. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

**Answer**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for transferring data on the web. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data being transferred. This ensures that the data remains secure and cannot be intercepted by malicious actors. HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as login credentials and payment details.

**Justification**: This answer clearly explains the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, highlighting the importance of security in web communication. It demonstrates an understanding of the need for encryption to protect data.

### 4. What are HTTP status codes and what do they signify?

**Answer**: HTTP status codes are standardized codes returned by the server to indicate the result of a client’s request. They are grouped into five categories:

- **1xx (Informational)**: Request received, continuing process.
- **2xx (Success)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted (e.g., 200 OK).
- **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).
- **4xx (Client Error)**: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled (e.g., 404 Not Found).
- **5xx (Server Error)**: The server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

**Justification**: This answer categorizes HTTP status codes and provides examples, demonstrating an understanding of how servers communicate the results of requests. It shows that you can interpret and handle different types of responses in web applications.

### 5. How do you handle HTTP sessions in a Java web application?

**Answer**: In a Java web application, HTTP sessions are typically managed using the `HttpSession` interface. When a client makes a request, the server can create a session object to store user-specific data. This session object is identified by a unique session ID, which is usually stored in a cookie on the client’s browser. The server can retrieve the session object using this ID to maintain state across multiple requests.

**Justification**: This answer explains how HTTP sessions are managed in Java, demonstrating practical knowledge of session handling. It shows that you understand how to maintain state in stateless HTTP communication, which is crucial for developing web applications.

### 6. What is [[REST]] and how does it relate to [[HTTP]]?

**Answer**: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol, typically HTTP. RESTful applications use HTTP methods explicitly and are designed around resources, which are identified by URLs. Each resource can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

**Justification**: This answer defines REST and explains its relationship with HTTP, demonstrating an understanding of RESTful principles and how they are applied in web development. It shows that you can design and implement RESTful APIs using HTTP.

### 7. What are HTTP headers and why are they important?

**Answer**: HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent in both HTTP requests and responses. They provide essential information about the request or response, such as content type, content length, server information, and caching directives. Headers play a crucial role in controlling how data is transmitted and processed, enabling features like content negotiation, authentication, and caching.

**Justification**: This answer explains the purpose and importance of HTTP headers, demonstrating an understanding of how they enhance and control HTTP communication. It shows that you can effectively use headers to manage various aspects of web requests and responses.
