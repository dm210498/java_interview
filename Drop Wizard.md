### 1. What is DropWizard and what are its main components?

**Answer**: DropWizard is a Java framework for developing RESTful web services. It bundles together several well-established libraries to provide a comprehensive, production-ready environment for building and deploying web applications. The main components of DropWizard include:

- **Jetty**: An embedded web server.
- **Jersey**: A framework for building RESTful web services.
- **Jackson**: A library for JSON processing.
- **Metrics**: A library for application metrics and monitoring.
- **Hibernate Validator**: A library for validating Java beans.

**Justification**: This answer provides a clear and concise overview of DropWizard and its main components, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the framework. It shows that you are familiar with the tools and libraries integrated into DropWizard, which is essential for developing robust web services.

### 2. How do you create a new DropWizard application?

**Answer**: To create a new DropWizard application, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the project**: Create a Maven or Gradle project and add DropWizard dependencies to your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
2. **Create the application class**: Extend the `Application` class and override the `run` and `initialize` methods.
3. **Create the configuration class**: Extend the `Configuration` class to define configuration properties.
4. **Create resources**: Define resource classes annotated with `@Path` and implement RESTful endpoints using Jersey.
5. **Run the application**: Package the application as a JAR file and run it using the DropWizard command.

Example:

Java

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application<MyConfiguration> {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new MyApplication().run(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void initialize(Bootstrap<MyConfiguration> bootstrap) {
        // Initialization logic
    }

    @Override
    public void run(MyConfiguration configuration, Environment environment) {
        // Register resources
        environment.jersey().register(new MyResource());
    }
}
```

AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. .

**Justification**: This answer provides a step-by-step guide to creating a DropWizard application, demonstrating practical knowledge of setting up and configuring a project. It shows that you can effectively use DropWizard to build web services.

### 3. How does DropWizard handle configuration?

**Answer**: DropWizard uses YAML files for configuration. The configuration class extends the `Configuration` class and maps the YAML properties to Java fields using Jackson annotations. This allows for easy and flexible configuration management. The configuration file is specified when running the application, and DropWizard automatically loads and validates the configuration.

Example configuration class:

Java

```java
public class MyConfiguration extends Configuration {
    @JsonProperty
    private String databaseUrl;

    public String getDatabaseUrl() {
        return databaseUrl;
    }
}
```

AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. .

Example YAML file (`config.yml`):

```yaml
databaseUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
```

**Justification**: This answer explains how DropWizard handles configuration using YAML files and Jackson annotations, demonstrating an understanding of configuration management. It shows that you can effectively manage and validate application settings.

### 4. What are DropWizard bundles and how are they used?

**Answer**: DropWizard bundles are reusable modules that encapsulate specific functionality and can be added to a DropWizard application. Bundles allow you to modularize your application and share common functionality across multiple projects. To use a bundle, you need to add it to the application’s `initialize` method.

Example:

Java

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application<MyConfiguration> {
    @Override
    public void initialize(Bootstrap<MyConfiguration> bootstrap) {
        bootstrap.addBundle(new MyCustomBundle());
    }
}
```

AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. .

**Justification**: This answer explains the concept of DropWizard bundles and how they are used, demonstrating an understanding of modularization and code reuse. It shows that you can extend and enhance DropWizard applications with reusable components.

### 5. How do you implement health checks in DropWizard?

**Answer**: Health checks in DropWizard are implemented by extending the `HealthCheck` class and overriding the `check` method. Health checks are used to monitor the health of your application and its dependencies. You register health checks in the application’s `run` method.

Example:

Java

```java
public class DatabaseHealthCheck extends HealthCheck {
    private final String databaseUrl;

    public DatabaseHealthCheck(String databaseUrl) {
        this.databaseUrl = databaseUrl;
    }

    @Override
    protected Result check() throws Exception {
        // Check database connectivity
        if (isDatabaseHealthy()) {
            return Result.healthy();
        } else {
            return Result.unhealthy("Cannot connect to " + databaseUrl);
        }
    }

    private boolean isDatabaseHealthy() {
        // Implement database health check logic
        return true;
    }
}
```

AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. .

Registering the health check:

Java

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application<MyConfiguration> {
    @Override
    public void run(MyConfiguration configuration, Environment environment) {
        environment.healthChecks().register("database", new DatabaseHealthCheck(configuration.getDatabaseUrl()));
    }
}
```

AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. .

**Justification**: This answer provides a practical example of implementing health checks in DropWizard, demonstrating an understanding of monitoring and maintaining application health. It shows that you can ensure the reliability and availability of your services.
