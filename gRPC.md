### 1. What is gRPC and how does it work?

**Answer**: gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google for building distributed systems and microservices. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the interface definition language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more. gRPC allows you to define services and specify methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. The client and server communicate through generated code based on the protobuf definitions.

**Justification**: This answer provides a clear and concise explanation of gRPC, covering its purpose, underlying technologies, and basic operation. It demonstrates a fundamental understanding of how gRPC facilitates efficient communication in distributed systems, which is essential for a Senior Java Developer.

### 2. How does gRPC leverage HTTP/2’s capabilities?

**Answer**: gRPC leverages several key features of HTTP/2 to enhance communication efficiency:

- **Multiplexing**: Multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single TCP connection, reducing latency and improving throughput.
- **Binary Framing**: Data is transmitted in a compact binary format, which is more efficient than text-based formats like JSON.
- **Header Compression**: HTTP/2 compresses headers, reducing the overhead of repeated header information.
- **Server Push**: The server can push responses to the client without the client explicitly requesting them, which can improve performance in certain scenarios.

**Justification**: This answer explains how gRPC benefits from HTTP/2 features, demonstrating an understanding of the technical advantages that make gRPC a high-performance framework. It shows that you are aware of the underlying protocols that contribute to gRPC’s efficiency.

### 3. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of using gRPC over REST?

**Answer**: **Advantages**:

- **Performance**: gRPC uses HTTP/2 and protobuf, which are more efficient than HTTP/1.1 and JSON used by REST.
- **Streaming**: gRPC supports bi-directional streaming, allowing for real-time data exchange.
- **Strong Typing**: Protobuf provides strong typing and schema validation, reducing errors.
- **Language Support**: gRPC supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for polyglot environments.

**Disadvantages**:

- **Complexity**: gRPC can be more complex to set up and debug compared to REST.
- **Browser Support**: gRPC is not natively supported in browsers, requiring additional tools like gRPC-Web.
- **Tooling**: REST has more mature tooling and broader community support.

**Justification**: This answer provides a balanced view of the pros and cons of gRPC compared to REST, demonstrating an understanding of when to use each technology. It shows that you can evaluate and choose the appropriate tool based on project requirements.

### 4. How can you implement authentication in gRPC?

**Answer**: Authentication in gRPC can be implemented using several methods:

- **TLS/SSL**: Encrypts the communication channel and can be used to authenticate clients and servers.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Using tokens such as OAuth2 tokens passed in metadata headers.
- **Custom Authentication**: Implementing custom authentication logic using interceptors to validate credentials.

**Justification**: This answer outlines multiple authentication methods, demonstrating an understanding of security practices in gRPC. It shows that you can implement secure communication in your services.

### 5. Can you discuss the role and functionality of Protocol Buffers in gRPC?

**Answer**: Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. In gRPC, protobuf is used to define the service interface and the structure of the payload messages. The `.proto` files are compiled to generate client and server code in various programming languages, ensuring consistent data serialization and deserialization across different platforms.

**Justification**: This answer explains the role of protobuf in gRPC, demonstrating an understanding of how data serialization works in gRPC. It shows that you are familiar with the tools and processes used to define and implement gRPC services.
